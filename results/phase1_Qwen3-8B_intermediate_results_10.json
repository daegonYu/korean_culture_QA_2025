      "baseline_pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for a Korean idiom similar to the English phrase \"big mouth,\" which means someone who talks a lot or is gossipy. The options are 1. 손이 크다 (big hands), 2. 발이 넓다 (wide feet), 3. 입이 싸다 (small mouth), 4. 입이 무겁다 (heavy mouth).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the meaning of \"big mouth\" in English. It's not just about the size of the mouth but more about someone who talks a lot, maybe gossiping or being talkative. So the Korean equivalent should convey something similar.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\n1. 손이 크다 – Big hands. That's literal, but not related to talking. Probably not the answer.\n2. 발이 넓다 – Wide feet. Also literal and unrelated to speech. Not relevant.\n3. 입이 싸다 – Small mouth. That's the opposite of \"big mouth,\" so probably not.\n4. 입이 무겁다 – Heavy mouth. Wait, in Korean, \"입이 무겁다\" can mean someone who is quiet or doesn't talk much. But wait, sometimes idioms can have double meanings. Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, maybe there's another interpretation. Wait, \"입이 무겁다\" is usually used to describe someone who is quiet or doesn't speak much, like having a heavy mouth. But the question is asking for something similar to \"big mouth,\" which is talkative. So maybe option 3 is \"입이 싸다\" which is small mouth, but that's the opposite. Wait, but maybe there's a confusion here. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe \"입이 무겁다\" can be used in a different context. For example, if someone is very talkative, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, no. Let me think. In Korean, \"입이 무겁다\" is more about being quiet. So if \"big mouth\" is talkative, then the opposite would be \"heavy mouth\" meaning quiet. So that would make option 4 the opposite, not the same. Then the options given are 1-4, and the correct answer should be something else. Wait, but the options are 1 to 4, and the user is asking for a similar meaning to \"big mouth.\" So maybe the answer is none of the options? But that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, option 3 is \"입이 싸다\" which literally means small mouth. But in Korean, \"입이 싸다\" can also mean someone who is quiet or doesn't talk much, similar to \"heavy mouth.\" Wait, no. Wait, maybe there's a confusion between \"입이 싸다\" and \"입이 무겁다.\" Let me check. \n\nActually, \"입이 싸다\" (small mouth) is more about being quiet, not talking much. So that would be the opposite of \"big mouth.\" Then, \"입이 무겁다\" is also about being quiet. So both 3 and 4 are opposites. But the question is asking for a similar meaning to \"big mouth,\" which is talkative. So maybe none of the options are correct? But that's not possible. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to \"입이 싸다\" as a slang or a different meaning. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe \"입이 무겁다\" can have a different connotation. Wait, perhaps in some contexts, \"입이 무겁다\" could mean someone who talks a lot, but I don't think that's standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is none of the options, but since the user provided these options, there must be a correct one. Let me check again. The options are 1 to 4. The user is asking for a Korean idiom similar to \"big mouth.\" The correct answer should be the one that means talkative or gossipy. \n\nWait, maybe \"입이 싸다\" is not the opposite. Wait, \"입이 싸다\" is \"small mouth,\" but in some contexts, it can mean someone who is not talkative. So if \"big mouth\" is talkative, then the opposite would be \"small mouth\" or \"heavy mouth.\" But the question is asking for a similar meaning, not the opposite. Therefore, none of the options are correct. But since the user is expecting an answer, maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a confusion between \"입이 싸다\" and \"입이 많다.\" \"입이 많다\" means talkative, but",

      "simple_pred": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking for a Korean idiom that's similar in meaning to the English phrase 'big mouth'. The options are 1. 손이 크다 (big hands), 2. 발이 넓다 (wide feet), 3. 입이 싸다 (small mouth), 4. 입이 무겁다 (heavy mouth). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what 'big mouth' means in English. The phrase 'big mouth' usually refers to someone who talks a lot, maybe gossiping or saying things without thinking. It can also mean someone who is prone to revealing secrets or being indiscreet. So the key here is talking a lot or being talkative.\n\nNow, looking at the options. Let's go through each one. \n\nOption 1: 손이 크다 (big hands). That literally translates to having big hands. But how does that relate to talking? Maybe in some contexts, but I don't think there's a direct connection. Big hands might be a metaphor for something else, but not sure if it's related to talking.\n\nOption 2: 발이 넓다 (wide feet). Similar to the first option, this is about feet. I don't see a direct link to talking. Unless there's a cultural reference I'm missing, but I can't think of any. Probably not the right answer.\n\nOption 3: 입이 싸다 (small mouth). The literal translation is small mouth. But the question is about a 'big mouth', so this seems opposite. However, maybe there's a nuance. In Korean, '입이 싸다' can sometimes mean being quiet or not talking much, which is the opposite of a big mouth. So this might not be the right answer either.\n\nOption 4: 입이 무겁다 (heavy mouth). The literal translation is heavy mouth. But how does that relate to talking? Maybe in a metaphorical sense. If someone's mouth is heavy, they might be slow to speak, but that's not the same as a big mouth. Wait, but maybe in some contexts, '입이 무겁다' could imply that someone is talkative because they have a lot to say, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe '입이 무겁다' is used to describe someone who is indiscreet or talks too much, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about other Korean idioms. For example, '입이 빠르다' means to speak quickly, which is similar to being talkative. But that's not one of the options. Another possibility is '입이 떨어지다' which means to talk a lot, but again, not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe '입이 무겁다' is used in a different way. If someone's mouth is heavy, maybe they are too talkative, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. The English phrase 'big mouth' is about talking too much or being indiscreet. So the Korean equivalent would be something that implies talking a lot. \n\nLooking at the options again, option 3 is '입이 싸다' which is small mouth, which is the opposite. So that's not it. Option 4 is '입이 무겁다'. Maybe in some contexts, a heavy mouth could mean that someone is not talking much, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is option 3, but that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the question is a trick. If 'big mouth' is about talking a lot, then the opposite would be 'small mouth', but the question is asking for a similar meaning. So maybe none of the options are correct? But that's not possible. \n\nWait, maybe '입이 무겁다' is used to describe someone who is slow to speak, but that's not the same as a big mouth. Alternatively, in some contexts, '입이 무겁다' could mean that someone is not talkative, but again, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the options again. The options are 1. 손이 크다 (big hands), 2. 발이 넓다 (wide feet), 3. 입이 싸다 (small mouth), 4. 입이 무겁다 (heavy mouth). \n\nWait, maybe the answer is option 3, but that's the opposite. Unless there's a cultural nuance where '입이 싸다' is used to mean someone who talks a lot. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is option 4. Let me think about the phrase '입이 무겁다'. In Korean, '입이 무겁다' can sometimes mean that someone is not talking much, like being quiet. But if",

The user is asking for a Korean idiom similar to the English expression \"big mouth.\" The options are 1. 손이 크다 (big hands), 2. 발이 넓다 (wide feet), 3. 입이 싸다 (small mouth), 4. 입이 무겁다 (heavy mouth).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"big mouth\" means in English.

So that's not right. \"입이 무겁다\" – maybe it's a literal translation. But in Korean, \"입이 무겁다\" can mean someone who is talkative or has a lot to say. Alternatively, \"입이 무겁다\" might be used to describe someone who is not talkative, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe there's another idiom. Let me think. \"입이 빠르다\" (fast mouth) is someone who talks quickly, but that's not in the options. The options are 1-4. So between 3 and 4. \n\nWait, maybe \"입이 무겁다\" is the correct answer. Because in English, \"big mouth\" is someone who talks a lot, so \"heavy mouth\" might be a metaphor for that. Alternatively, maybe \"입이 싸다\" is the opposite. So the answer is 4. 입이 무겁다. But I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another expression. Let me check. In Korean, \"입이 무겁다\" is used to describe someone who is not talkative or has a lot of secrets, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, \"입이 무겁다\" can also mean someone who is talkative. For example, \"입이 무거운 사람\" might be someone who talks a lot. But I'm a bit confused. \n\nWait, another angle: \"big mouth\" as in someone who talks too much. So the Korean equivalent would be something like \"말이 많다\" (talkative), but that's not an idiom. The options given are 1-4. So the closest might be 4. 입이 무겁다. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is 3. 입이 싸다, but that's the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me think again. \"Big mouth\" in English can also mean someone who is indiscreet, so maybe \"입이 싸다\" is not the right one. So perhaps the answer is 4. 입이 무겁다. But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 3. 입이 싸다. Wait, no, because \"small mouth\" would mean not talking much. So the correct answer should be 4. 입이 무겁다.

It's not just about the size of the mouth but more about someone who talks a lot, maybe even gossiping or being indiscreet. So the Korean equivalent should convey that someone is talkative or has a tendency to speak without thinking.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\n1. 손이 크다 – Big hands. This doesn't relate to talking. Maybe someone with big hands is strong, but not related to speech. Probably not the answer.\n\n2. 발이 넓다 – Wide feet. Again, this is about body size, not speech. Doesn't fit.\n\n3. 입이 싸다 – Small mouth. Wait, \"small mouth\" in English can mean being quiet or not talking much. But the question is about a \"big mouth,\" so this seems opposite. Unless there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe in Korean, \"입이 싸다\" could have a different connotation? I need to check. \n\n4. 입이 무겁다 – Heavy mouth. This one is interesting. In Korean, \"입이 무겁다\" can mean being talkative or having a lot to say. Alternatively, it might refer to someone who is serious or doesn't speak much, but I think the more common meaning is that someone has a lot to say, hence a \"heavy mouth.\" Wait, but \"big mouth\" is about talking too much, so maybe \"입이 무겁다\" is the opposite? Or maybe it's about being silent? Hmm, I might need to verify the meanings.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again. In English, \"big mouth\" is negative, implying someone who talks too much or is gossipy. In Korean, the equivalent might be \"입이 빠르다\" (talkative) or \"입이 많다\" (has a lot to say). But those aren't in the options. The options given are 1-4. \n\nLooking at the options again: 3 is \"입이 싸다\" which is \"small mouth,\" which might mean being quiet, so opposite of big mouth. 4 is \"입이 무겁다.\" If \"입이 무겁다\" means being serious or not talkative, then it's opposite. But maybe in some contexts, it could mean someone who speaks a lot? Or maybe there's a different interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a confusion in the translation. Let me check the meanings of the options. \n\n\"입이 싸다\" – literally \"small mouth,\" but in Korean, \"입이 싸다\" can mean being quiet or not talking much. So that's the opposite of a big mouth. \n\n\"입이 무겁다\" – \"heavy mouth.\" In Korean, this phrase is sometimes used to describe someone who is serious or doesn't speak much, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe \"입이 무겁다\" is used to mean someone who is talkative? Or perhaps it's a mistranslation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 3. But that seems contradictory. Wait, the question is about a similar meaning to \"big mouth,\" which is someone who talks a lot. So the correct answer would be the one that implies being talkative. But none of the options directly say that. \n\nWait, maybe \"입이 무겁다\" is the answer. Let me think. If someone has a heavy mouth, maybe they speak a lot? Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm a bit confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a common idiom I'm not aware of. Let me check. In Korean, \"입이 빠르다\" (talkative) or \"입이 많다\" (has a lot to say) are more direct.

The user is asking for a Korean idiom that's similar in meaning to the English phrase \"big mouth.\" The options are 1. 손이 크다 (big hands), 2. 발이 넓다 (wide feet), 3. 입이 싸다 (chatty mouth), 4. 입이 무겁다 (heavy mouth).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"big mouth\" means in English. It typically refers to someone who talks a lot, is gossipy, or maybe even someone who says things without thinking, leading to problems. So the key aspects here are talking a lot and possibly being careless with words.\n\nNow, looking at the Korean options. Let's go through each one:\n\n1. 손이 크다 - \"Big hands.\" This literally translates to having large hands, but in Korean, it's not commonly used as an idiom. It might be used metaphorically, but I don't think it's a standard expression for someone who talks a lot.\n\n2. 발이 넓다 - \"Wide feet.\" Similar to the first option, this is a literal description. In Korean, \"발이 넓다\" isn't an idiom. It might be used in a different context, like being open-minded, but that's a stretch. Not likely the answer here.\n\n3. 입이 싸다 - \"Chatty mouth.\" The word \"싸다\" here might be a bit confusing. Wait, \"입이 싸다\" literally means \"a mouth that is chatty\" or \"talkative.\" But in Korean, \"입이 싸다\" is actually an idiom that means someone who talks a lot, especially in a negative way, like being gossiping or spreading rumors. That seems to fit the \"big mouth\" meaning.\n\n4. 입이 무겁다 - \"Heavy mouth.\" This phrase usually refers to someone who is quiet or doesn't speak much. The word \"무겁다\" means heavy, so \"heavy mouth\" would imply being reserved or not talking much, which is the opposite of \"big mouth.\" So this is probably not the answer.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. Let me double-check. \"입이 싸다\" is indeed used to describe someone who talks a lot, especially in a negative context. For example, if someone is always gossiping, you might say \"입이 싸다.\" So that's a direct match for \"big mouth.\"\n\nThe other options don't fit.

Not sure if it's used for talking a lot. Maybe in some contexts, but not common.\n\n2. 발이 넓다 – \"Wide feet.\" This seems more like a literal description.

The options are 신앙수, 정화수, 정령수, and 기도수. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the meanings of each term. Let's break them down one by one.\n\n신앙수 (Sinaengsu) translates to \"faith water.\" I'm not sure about this one. It might relate to water used in religious contexts, but I'm not certain if it's specifically about leaving water for spirits.\n\n정화수 (Jeonghwasu) means \"purification water.\" This sounds like water used for cleansing, maybe in rituals to purify oneself before praying. But the question is about water left for the spirit, not necessarily for purification.\n\n정령수 (Jeongryeongsu) translates to \"spirit water.\" This seems closer. In some shamanic practices, offerings are made to spirits, and water might be part of that. But I need to confirm if \"정령수\" specifically refers to water left for spirits.\n\n기도수 (Gidoksu) is \"prayer water.\" This could be water used during prayer, but again, the question is about water left when praying, not the water used in the act of praying.\n\nNow, thinking about Korean shamanism (무속신앙), there are rituals where offerings are made to spirits. Sometimes, water is used as an offering. The term \"정령수\" might refer to water that's left as an offering to the spirit, hence \"spirit water.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"정화수\" could be part of a purification ritual before offering, but the question specifies the water left when praying, not the preparatory step. \n\nAnother angle: in some traditions, when you pray to a spirit, you might leave a container of water as an offering. \"정령수\" directly relates to spirits, so that's a strong candidate. \n\nI should verify if there's a specific term for this. Maybe checking some references. For example, in Korean shamanism, offerings can include water, rice, etc. The term \"정령수\" might be used for water offerings to spirits. \n\nAlternatively, \"신앙수\" could be related to faith, but I'm not sure. \"기도수\" is more about prayer, not necessarily left as an offering. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely 정령수 (Jeongryeongsu) because it directly refers to water related to spirits, which fits the context of leaving water for a spirit when praying.\n</think>\n\n**답변:** 3. 정령수  \n\n**설명:**  \n한국의 신앙 문화에서 신령(정령)에게 빌 때 떠놓는 물을 \"정령수\"라고 합니다. 이는 무속신앙(巫俗信仰)이나 신앙적 의식에서 신령에게 제물로 드리는 물을 가리키며, 정화(淨化)나 기도(祈禱)와는 다른 개념입니다. \"정령수\"는 신령과의 소통을 위해 준비된 물로, 신령에게 떠놓는 의식적 제물로 해석됩니다.  \n\n- **신앙수(1):** 신앙에 대한 믿음이나 신앙을 상징하는 물을 의미할 수 있으나, 구체적인 의식적 제물로는 적절하지 않습니다.  \n- **정화수(2):** 정화(청결)를 위한 물로, 의식 전에 사용되는 경우가 많습니다.  \n- **기도수(4):** 기도를 위한 물로, 의식 중에 사용되는 물을 가리키지만, 떠놓는 제물로는 부합하지 않습니다.  \n- **정령수(3):** 신령에게 떠놓는 물을 특별히 가리키는 용어로, 정답입니다.",

The options are 신앙수, 정화수, 정령수, and 기도수.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the terms related to spiritual practices in Korea. I remember that in shamanism, there are various rituals involving water. The term \"정령수\" comes to mind because \"정령\" means spirit or deity, so \"정령수\" might refer to water left for a spirit. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. \"신앙수\" is \"faith water,\" which might be more about faith rather than a specific ritual. \"정화수\" is \"purification water,\" which could be used in cleansing rituals. \"기도수\" is \"prayer water,\" which seems like it's directly related to prayer. \n\nHowever, the question specifies the water left for a spirit when making a prayer. In traditional Korean shamanism, there's a practice where water is offered to the spirit. The term \"정령수\" specifically refers to water left for the spirit, so that's likely the answer.

      "expert_pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about a term in Korean culture related to leaving water for a spirit. The options are 신앙수, 정화수, 정령수, and 기도수. I need to figure out which one refers to the water left for a spirit.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what I know about Korean shamanism and rituals. In traditional Korean beliefs, there are various practices involving spirits, like the Jeju Island's \"Jeju Haenyeo\" or the use of water in rituals. But maybe more directly, there's something called \"정령수\" which I think relates to spirits. Wait, \"정령\" means spirit or spirit world, so \"정령수\" could be spirit water. But I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, \"신앙수\" is faith water, which might be more general. \"정화수\" is purification water, which is used in cleansing rituals. \"기도수\" is prayer water, used for prayers. But the question is about water left for a spirit, not necessarily for purification or prayer. \n\nIn some shamanic rituals, there's a practice where water is offered to spirits. I think the term \"정령수\" is associated with that. For example, in the context of \"정령수\" being used in rituals to appease or honor spirits. However, I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes in Korean folk traditions, people leave water as an offering. The term \"정령수\" might specifically refer to water used in rituals involving spirits.

For instance, in some areas, people might leave water in a specific place as a offering to spirits, and that's called \"정령수\". So the answer might be 3, 정령수.

So \"경단\" literally translates to \"examination cake,\" which makes sense as a wish for success. \n\nBut I should double-check if there's another term. Sometimes, \"백설기\" is also used in the context of exams, but I think that's more of a dessert. \"팥떡\" is more associated with holidays. \"찰떡\" is a general term for chewy rice cakes. \n\nAnother angle: in some regions, \"경단\" is specifically made for exam season. Also, the shape of the rice cake might resemble a \"gold\" or \"success\" symbol, which is common in traditional wishes. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be 경단 (gyeongdan), option 1.\n</think>\n\n답변: 1. 경단  \n한국에서 시험 합격을 기원하기 위해 먹는 떡은 **경단**(경단)입니다. \"경\"은 시험(경시) 또는 경쟁을 의미하고, \"단\"은 떡을 가리키는 말로, 합격을 기원하는 은유적 의미를 담고 있습니다. 특히 대학수학능력시험(수능) 등 중요한 시험 전후에 주어지는 선물로 널리 알려져 있으며, 떡의 모양이나 이름에서 성공을 상징하는 의미가 내재되어 있습니다. 다른 옵션인 백설기(백설기)는 일반적인 빵류, 팥떡(패드락)은 명절에 먹는 떡, 찰떡(찰떡)은 축제나 행사에 먹는 떡으로 시험 기원과 직접적인 연관성이 없습니다.",

I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what each of these snacks are. 경단 is a type of rice cake made with glutinous rice flour, often sweetened with honey or syrup. It's commonly eaten during festivals or special occasions. 백설기는 a sweet rice cake made with rice flour and sugar, usually shaped like a ball. 팥떡 is a sweet rice cake filled with sweetened red bean paste. 찰떡 refers to a variety of chewy rice cakes, often sweet, like those found in sweet shops.\n\nNow, thinking about exam success. In Korea, there's a tradition where people eat certain foods to bring good luck. I remember that during the Sae-jeong (사정) or important exams, like the CSAT (Civil Service Exam) or college entrance exams, people might eat specific snacks. \n\nI think 경단 is associated with good luck. There's a story where a scholar named Kim Sujin used to eat 경단 before exams, and it became a tradition. So, 경단 is often linked to exam success. \n\n백설기 is more of a sweet treat, maybe for general luck, but not specifically for exams. 팥떡 is a sweet rice cake with red bean paste, which is popular but not specifically tied to exams. 찰떡 is a general term for chewy rice cakes, which might be eaten during festivals but not specifically for exams. \n\nSo the answer should be 1, 경단.\n</think>\n\n1",

In Korean culture, certain foods are associated with good luck. For example, 찰떡 is known as a traditional New Year's food, symbolizing prosperity. But the question specifically mentions exams.

But I need to confirm the data for South Korea specifically in 2023. Wait, I should check if there are any recent statistics or reports. From what I know, South Korea has been dealing with high suicide rates, especially among youth. There was a lot of news about the suicide rate among teenagers and young adults. \n\nBut wait, the options include 0-10s and 10-30s. I think the 10-30 age group might have higher rates. However, I also recall that in some countries, older adults have higher suicide rates due to factors like social isolation, health issues, and lack of support. But in South Korea, the suicide rate for the elderly might be lower compared to some other countries. \n\nWait, maybe the data shows that the 10-30 age group has the highest rate. But I need to be careful. Let me think about the statistics. I remember that South Korea's suicide rate among adolescents and young adults is quite high. There was a report that the suicide rate for people aged 10-24 was the highest. However, the options here are 10-30s, which would include that age group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 40-60 age group has a higher rate. Wait, but I think the youth suicide rate is higher. Also, considering the social pressures in South Korea, like academic stress for students and young adults, that could contribute to higher suicide rates. \n\nBut I should also consider the 70s and above. In some countries, the elderly have higher suicide rates, but in South Korea, the suicide rate for the elderly might be lower. However, I'm not sure. Maybe the data shows that the 10-30 age group is the highest. \n\nWait, I need to check if there's a specific statistic. For example, the Korean National Statistical Office or the Ministry of Health might have data. From what I recall, in recent years, the suicide rate for those aged 10-24 was the highest. So the 10-30 age group would include that. Therefore, the answer might be option 2. \n\nBut I should also consider that the 40-60 age group might have higher rates due to economic pressures, but I think the youth suicide rate is still higher. So the answer is 10-30s. But I need to be careful. Maybe the correct answer is 40-60s? Wait, no, I think the youth rate is higher. Let me confirm. \n\nAnother angle: suicide rates often peak in adolescence and early adulthood. In South Korea, there have been reports of high suicide rates among teenagers and young adults, especially due to academic pressure and mental health issues. So the 10-30 age group (option 2) would be the highest. However, I should also check if the 70s and above have higher rates. \n\nWait, according to some sources, the suicide rate for the elderly in South Korea is lower compared to other age groups. For example, in 2022, the suicide rate for people aged 70 and above was lower than for younger groups. Therefore, the highest rate is likely in the 10-30 age group. \n\nBut I need to be precise.

The question is asking which age group has the highest probability of committing suicide. The options are 0-10, 10-30, 40-60, and 70+. \n\nFirst, I should recall general trends in suicide rates by age. I know that suicide rates can vary significantly across different age groups. In many countries, younger people, especially adolescents and young adults, might have higher suicide rates due to factors like mental health issues, academic pressure, or social challenges. However, older adults, particularly those in their 70s and above, might also have higher rates because of issues like loneliness, chronic illness, or loss of loved ones. \n\nBut wait, I should be careful here. In some studies, the elderly population might have higher suicide rates compared to younger groups. For example, in South Korea, there's been a notable increase in suicide rates among the elderly, possibly due to social isolation, economic pressures, or lack of support systems. However, I also remember that in some cases, younger age groups, especially males in their late teens to early 20s, might have higher rates. \n\nWait, but the options here are 0-10, 10-30, 40-60, and 70+. Let me think. The 0-10 group is children, which typically have lower suicide rates. The 10-30 group includes teenagers and young adults. The 40-60 group is middle-aged adults, and 70+ is the elderly. \n\nI think in South Korea, the suicide rate for the elderly (70+) might be higher than other groups. I recall reading that South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among the elderly in the world. However, I should verify if that's the case. Also, there might be gender differences. For example, males in the 10-30 age group might have higher rates, but the question is about the highest probability overall. \n\nWait, but the question is about the highest probability. So if the elderly have higher rates, then the answer would be 70+. However, I need to check if that's accurate for 2023. I should consider that suicide rates can fluctuate year by year. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 40-60 age group has higher rates. But I think in many countries, the elderly have higher suicide rates. For example, in South Korea, the suicide rate among the elderly has been increasing, possibly due to factors like social isolation, economic hardship, or lack of mental health resources. \n\nWait, but I should also consider that the 10-30 age group might have higher rates, especially among males. However, the question is about the highest probability. If the elderly have higher rates, then 70+ would be the answer. \n\nI need to recall specific data. Let me think. According to recent statistics, in South Korea, the suicide rate for people aged 70 and over is indeed the highest. For example, in 2021, the suicide rate for the 70+ age group was higher than other groups. However, I should check if this trend continued into 2023. \n\nAnother point: the 10-30 age group includes teenagers and young adults, which might have higher suicide rates due to mental health issues, but the absolute numbers might be lower compared to the elderly. However, the question is about the probability, which is the rate per 100,000 people. \n\nSo, if the elderly have a higher rate, then the answer is 4. 70대 이상. But I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 40-60 age group is the highest. But I think in South Korea, the elderly have the highest suicide rates.

Let me start by recalling what I know about the Joseon Dynasty's foreign relations and their administrative systems.\n\nFirst, the Joseon Dynasty was a Korean kingdom that lasted from 1392 to 1897. They had a policy of isolationism, especially after the late 16th century, which is known as the \"Sino-Korean\" or \"Chosun\" policy. They limited foreign contact, mainly with China and Japan. \n\nNow, the question mentions \"Tongri Gimmu Amon\" (통리기무아문). I think that's a specific office or department. Let me break down the term. \"Tongri\" might refer to the Ministry of Rites (예조, Yejo), which handled ceremonial and diplomatic affairs. \"Gimmu\" could be the Ministry of Military Affairs (기무, Gimu), which dealt with military matters. \"Amon\" might be the Office of the Imperial Secretary (아문, Amon), which was responsible for official documents and correspondence. So combining these, the Tongri Gimmu Amon might be a specific office within the government that handled foreign affairs, possibly related to issuing permits.\n\nThe question is about a travel permit given to foreigners who came to the Joseon Dynasty. The answer should be the name of this permit. I remember that the Joseon Dynasty had a system where they allowed limited foreign visitors, especially Chinese envoys, but they had strict regulations. The travel permit for foreigners might be called a \"passport\" or a specific term in Korean.\n\nWait, I think the term is \"Hwagwan\" (화관). Hwagwan was the official travel document used by foreign envoys, especially Chinese and Japanese, to enter Joseon. It was issued by the government and allowed them to travel within the kingdom. The Hwagwan would have specific details like the traveler's name, purpose of visit, and the official who issued it. \n\nBut I need to confirm if this is the correct term. Another term I've heard is \"Gyeongjeok\" (경접), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's called \"Hwagwanjeon\" (화관전), which is the official document. However, the key term here is \"Hwagwan.\" \n\nLet me check if the Tongri Gimmu Amon is associated with issuing these permits. Since the Ministry of Rites handled diplomatic relations, it's possible that the Hwagwan was issued through that department. The Amon office might have been involved in the administrative process of issuing these permits. \n\nSo putting it all together, the travel permit issued to foreigners by the Tongri Gimmu Amon is called the Hwagwan. Therefore, the answer should be \"화관\" (Hwagwan).\n</think>\n\n조선 후기 통리기무아문(통리기무아문)에서 외국인에게 발급하던 여행허가증은 **화관(華館)**입니다.  \n\n화관은 중국, 일본 등 외국 대사나 무역사절이 조선에 진입할 때 필요한 공식적인 여행허가증으로, 외국인의 신분, 방문 목적, 체류 기간 등을 기재한 문서였습니다. 이는 조선의 외교 및 관리 체계에 따라 발급되며, 통리기무아문(예조, 기무사, 아문 등 관련 기관)이 주요 관할 기관이었습니다. 화관은 조선의 외교 정책과 외국인 통제를 위해 엄격하게 관리되었으며, 특히 중국과의 관계에서 중요한 역할을 했습니다.",

      "simple_pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a travel permit issued to foreigners in the Joseon Dynasty's Tongli Gimmun Ommun. First, I need to recall what I know about the Joseon Dynasty's foreign relations and administrative systems.\n\nThe Joseon Dynasty had strict policies towards foreigners, especially after the Imjin War (1592-1598). They were wary of foreign influences, so they implemented measures to control foreign visitors. The term \"Tongli Gimmun Ommun\" might be a bit tricky. Let me break it down. \"Tongli\" could refer to the Ministry of Rites or the Ministry of Personnel, but I'm not entirely sure. \"Gimmun\" might be related to the \"Gimcheon\" or the \"Gimjeong\" system, which was a way to manage foreign visitors. \"Ommun\" might be a typo or a mispronunciation of \"Ommun,\" which I think refers to the \"Ommun\" or \"Ommun\" system, which was a permit system for foreigners.\n\nWait, I remember that the Joseon Dynasty had a system called \"Gimcheon\" (기천) or \"Gimjeong\" (기정), which was a type of permit for foreigners to enter the country. The \"Gimjeong\" system required foreigners to obtain a permit to travel within the kingdom. The permit was called \"Gimjeongpum\" (기정품) or \"Gimjeongpum\" (기정품). Alternatively, there's also the \"Ommun\" (오문) system, which might be related. \n\nBut the question specifically mentions \"Tongli Gimmun Ommun.\" Maybe it's referring to the \"Tongli\" (통리) which is the Ministry of Rites, and \"Gimmun Ommun\" (기문 오문) could be a mistranslation or a specific term. Alternatively, the correct term might be \"Gimjeongpum\" (기정품), which was the official travel permit for foreigners. \n\nI think the correct answer is \"Gimjeongpum\" (기정품), which was the travel permit issued to foreigners visiting the Joseon Dynasty. However, I need to confirm if \"Tongli Gimmun Ommun\" refers to this system. Alternatively, there's the \"Ommun\" (오문) system, which might be the same as the \"Gimjeongpum.\" \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the \"Ommun\" (오문) or \"Ommun\" system, which was a permit system. The term \"Tongli Gimmun Ommun\" might be a combination of different terms. Alternatively, the correct term is \"Gimjeongpum.\" \n\nTo be safe, I'll go with \"Gimjeongpum\" (기정품) as the answer, which is the travel permit for foreigners in the Joseon Dynasty. But I should check if there's another term. Another possibility is \"Ommun\" (오문), which was a type of permit. However, I think \"Gimjeongpum\" is more accurate. \n\nSo, the answer is \"Gimjeongpum\" (기정품), which was the travel permit issued to foreigners in the Joseon Dynasty.\n</think>\n\n답변: 기정품",

The Joseon Dynasty had strict regulations regarding foreigners, especially during the late period. The Tongri Gimmu Amun was an institution responsible for managing foreign affairs, including the entry and exit of foreigners. \n\nI remember that there was a specific document called a \"Jinjeong\" (진정) or \"Jinjeongjeon\" (진정전). The Jinjeong was a permit that allowed foreigners to travel within the Joseon territory, particularly to access the royal court. It was a crucial document for foreign envoys, especially from China, as they needed permission to enter the country and meet the king.\n\nWait, but the question mentions the \"Tongri Gimmu Amun\" which I think is the correct term. Let me confirm. \"Tongri\" refers to the Office of the Grand Secretary, and \"Gimmu Amun\" might be the Office of the Minister of Rites or the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The correct term for the travel permit is likely \"Jinjeong\" or \"Jinjeongjeon.\" \n\nAnother term that comes to mind is \"Gyeongjeong\" (경정), but I think that's different. The Jinjeong was specifically for granting permission to foreigners to enter the country and travel, while the Gyeongjeong might relate to something else. \n\nI should verify if there's a more precise term. In some sources, the document is referred to as \"Jinjeong\" (진정), which is a travel permit. The process involved the foreigner obtaining this permit from the Tongri Gimmu Amun to travel within the Joseon territory. \n\nYes, I'm pretty confident the answer is \"Jinjeong\" or \"Jinjeongjeon.\" But I need to check if there's a standard term used in historical records. Some sources might use \"Jinjeong\" as the primary term. \n\nAlternatively, there's also the \"Gyeongjeong\" (경정), but that might be related to a different context.

I don't think there have been any significant changes to the class duration in recent years. The curriculum and school schedules have remained relatively consistent. \n\nAnother point to consider: some schools might have different schedules, especially private schools or those with special programs.

Let me start by recalling what I know about the Korean education system. I remember that school schedules can vary slightly between schools, but there's a standard structure.\n\nFirst, I think about the typical school day in Korea. Middle school, or \"중학교\" (chung hakgyo), usually starts around 8:30 or 9:00 AM and ends around 4:00 PM. Now, how many classes are there in a day? I believe there are about 6 to 7 classes, but I need to confirm the exact number of periods. Wait, maybe each class is a certain length. \n\nI think each class period in Korea is 45 minutes long. But I should check if that's consistent. Sometimes, there might be a 50-minute period, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. If there are 7 classes a day, and the school day is around 6 hours, then 6 hours divided by 7 classes would be roughly 51 minutes, but that doesn't align with the 45-minute idea. Maybe the total time is a bit more. \n\nWait, perhaps the school day is structured with specific breaks. For example, there might be a lunch break and short breaks between classes. So, if the school starts at 8:30 and ends at 4:00, that's 7.5 hours. Subtracting breaks, maybe 30 minutes for lunch and 10 minutes for each short break. Let's do the math: 7.5 hours is 450 minutes. If there are 5 classes, each 45 minutes, that's 225 minutes. Then breaks would be 450 - 225 = 225 minutes. That seems too much. Maybe the number of classes is different.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that in some schools, each class is 45 minutes, and there are 7 periods a day. Let's check: 7 classes × 45 minutes = 315 minutes. Then, the total school day would be 315 minutes plus breaks. If breaks are 30 minutes for lunch and 10 minutes between classes, that's 30 + (6 × 10) = 90 minutes. Total would be 315 + 90 = 405 minutes, which is 6 hours and 45 minutes. That fits with a school day starting at 8:30 and ending at 3:15 PM, but I think some schools might end later. \n\nWait, maybe the standard is 45 minutes per class.

The user wants a list of the special cities, metropolitan cities, provinces, special self-governing provinces, and special self-governing cities. I need to make sure I get the terms right and the correct entities.\n\nFirst, I remember that South Korea has a hierarchical administrative structure. The main categories are special cities (특별시), metropolitan cities (광역시), provinces (도), special self-governing provinces (특별자치도), and special self-governing cities (특별자치시). Wait, I think there's a distinction between the special self-governing provinces and cities. Let me confirm the exact terms.\n\nSpecial cities like Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan are the ones with special status. Then there are the metropolitan cities, which might be the same as the special cities? Wait, no. Wait, I think the special cities are the ones that have a higher status than regular cities. But maybe the terms are a bit different. Let me check again.\n\nActually, in South Korea, the administrative divisions are divided into provinces (도) and cities (시). But some cities have special status. The special cities (특별시) include Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan. These are the ones with special status. Then there are the metropolitan cities (광역시), but wait, isn't that the same as the special cities? Or is there a difference? Wait, maybe the term \"광역시\" refers to cities that are part of a metropolitan area but are not special cities. But I might be confusing this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, I think there are two types of cities: special cities (특별시) and metropolitan cities (광역시). But actually, I think the special cities are considered metropolitan cities. Maybe the terms are used interchangeably, but there's a distinction. Alternatively, perhaps the metropolitan cities are the ones that are not special cities. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me recall the exact structure.\n\nIn South Korea, the administrative divisions are as follows:\n\n1. Special Cities (특별시): Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, Ulsan. These are cities with special status, which means they have more autonomy and are treated as separate from the provinces.\n\n2. Metropolitan Cities (광역시): These are cities that are part of a metropolitan area but are not special cities. Wait, but I think that the term \"광역시\" might not be used anymore. Maybe the special cities are the ones that are considered metropolitan cities. Alternatively, perhaps the metropolitan cities are the same as the special cities. I need to clarify this.\n\nWait, I think there was a reorganization in 2010 where some cities were upgraded. For example, Gwangju and Daejeon became special cities. So the current special cities are the seven mentioned. Then, the other cities are regular cities (일반시) and provinces (도). However, there are also special self-governing provinces (특별자치도) and special self-governing cities (특별자치시). \n\nWait, but I think that the special self-governing provinces are Jeju Special Self-Governing Province (제주특별자치도) and the special self-governing cities are none, because the special cities are already the highest level. Or is there a special self-governing city? Maybe not. So the structure is:\n\n- Special Cities (특별시): Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, Ulsan\n\n- Metropolitan Cities (광역시): I'm not sure if there are any left. Wait, maybe the term \"광역시\" is used for cities that are part of a metropolitan area but are not special cities. But I think the current administrative structure doesn't have \"광역시\" as a separate category. Maybe the special cities are the only ones with special status, and the rest are regular cities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"광역시\" refers to cities that are part of a metropolitan area, which includes the special cities. So the special cities are a subset of metropolitan cities. But I need to check this.\n\nAlso, the special self-governing provinces (특별자치도) is Jeju, and there's no special self-governing city yet. So putting it all together:\n\n- Special Cities (특별시): Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, Ulsan\n\n- Metropolitan Cities (광역시): Maybe there are no separate metropolitan cities now, since the special cities are the ones with higher status.

There are also special self-governing cities (특별자치시). \n\nWait, I think there are currently no special self-governing cities (특별자치시) in South Korea. The special self-governing provinces are Jeju Special Self-Governing Province (제주특별자치도). \n\nSo, to answer the question: \n\n- Special cities (특별시): Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Gwangju, Daegu, Daejeon, Ulsan. \n\n- Provinces (도): Gyeonggi, Chungcheongbuk, Chungcheongnam, Jeollabuk, Jeollanam, Gyeongsangbuk, Gyeongsangnam. \n\n- Special self-governing provinces (특별자치도): Jeju. \n\n- Special self-governing cities (특별자치시): None currently. \n\nBut the question mentions \"특별자치시\" as a category. Maybe there are some cities that are designated as special self-governing cities. Wait, I think there are none. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the special cities as \"광역시\" (metropolitan cities) and the provinces as \"도\". But I need to make sure. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct categorization is: \n\n- Special cities (특별시): Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Gwangju, Daegu, Daejeon, Ulsan. \n\n- Metropolitan cities (광역시): This term might not be used in the current classification. \n\nWait, I think the confusion comes from the fact that the special cities are considered the same as the metropolitan cities.

First, there are special cities like Seoul, Busan, Incheon, and Daegu. Then there are metropolitan cities such as Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan. Next, provinces, which are called 'do' in Korean, like Gyeonggi, Chungcheongbuk, etc. Then there are special self-governing provinces, which I think are Jeju and Gyeonggi? Wait, no, Jeju is a special self-governing province, and Gyeonggi is a province. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the special self-governing provinces are Jeju and maybe some others? Or is there only Jeju? Also, there are special self-governing cities, like Gwangju and Daejeon? Or are those considered metropolitan cities? I need to be careful here. The user mentioned special self-governing provinces (특별자치도) and special self-governing cities (특별자치시). So Jeju is a special self-governing province, and maybe there are others? Wait, I think Gyeonggi is a province, not a special self-governing one. So the special self-governing provinces are Jeju. Then, the special self-governing cities would be cities like Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan? Or are they considered metropolitan cities? Hmm, I need to make sure. \n\nLet me structure this properly. The main categories are: special cities (특별시), metropolitan cities (광역시), provinces (도), special self-governing provinces (특별자치도), and special self-governing cities (특별자치시). \n\nWait, the user listed all five categories: 특별시, 광역시, 도, 특별자치도, 특별자치시. So I need to list each category with their examples. \n\nSpecial cities are Seoul, Busan, Incheon, and Daegu. Metropolitan cities are Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan. Provinces are the 17 provinces, like Gyeonggi, Chungcheongbuk, etc. Special self-governing provinces are Jeju. Special self-governing cities are Gwangju and Daejeon? Or are they part of the metropolitan cities? Wait, no. Wait, I think Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan are metropolitan cities. But then there are special self-governing cities. Wait, maybe the special self-governing cities are separate. Let me verify. \n\nAccording to my knowledge, the special self-governing cities (특별자치시) are Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan. But wait, aren't they already metropolitan cities? Or is there a distinction? I might be confused here. Let me check again. \n\nActually, metropolitan cities (광역시) are cities that have a higher level of autonomy compared to general cities. Special self-governing cities (특별자치시) are cities that have even more autonomy. So Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan are both metropolitan cities and special self-governing cities? Or are they considered as special self-governing cities? Wait, no. The special self-governing cities are separate from the metropolitan cities. Wait, maybe the user is referring to the classification where some cities are both metropolitan cities and special self-governing cities. \n\nWait, I need to get this straight. The current administrative divisions of South Korea include:\n\n1. Special cities (특별시): Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Daegu\n2. Metropolitan cities (광역시): Gwangju, Daejeon, Ulsan, Gyeonggi (Wait, no, Gyeonggi is a province)\nWait, no. The provinces are called 'do', and the special self-governing provinces are Jeju. \n\nWait, maybe I should list them as:\n\n- 특별시: 서울, 부산, 인천, 대구\n- 광역시: 광주, 대전, 울산\n- 도: 경기도, 충청도, 전라북도, 전라남도, 경상북도, 경상남도, 제주도 (Wait, 제주도 is a special self-governing province, not a '도')\nWait, there's confusion here. Let me correct. \n\nThe provinces (도) are 17 in total. But Jeju is a special self-governing province (특별자치도), so it's not part of the regular provinces. So the regular provinces are 16, and Jeju is",

Let me start by recalling what I know about Korean family structures. \n\nFirst, I remember that traditional Korean families were often extended families, where multiple generations lived together. But with modernization, this has changed. However, the term \"대가족\" might still refer to a large family structure, even if it's not as common as before.\n\nI should define \"대가족\" as a family that includes multiple generations living together, like grandparents, parents, and children. Maybe also include extended family members like aunts, uncles, or cousins. It's important to note that this is different from the nuclear family, which is just parents and children.\n\nAlso, I should mention the historical context. In the past, especially in rural areas, big families were more common because they helped with agricultural work and shared resources. But with urbanization and the rise of individualism, big families have become less prevalent. However, some families might still maintain this structure for cultural or economic reasons.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is accurate and not mixing up terms. Maybe clarify that \"대가족\" specifically refers to the extended family living together, not just a large number of people. Also, mention that it's one of the traditional family types in Korea, contrasting with the nuclear family that's more common today.\n\nWait, I should check if there are any other nuances. For example, sometimes \"대가족\" might be used in a more general sense to mean a large family, even if not all generations are living together. But the core idea is the extended family structure. Also, maybe include that this structure has been changing due to factors like women's participation in the workforce and urbanization.\n\nI need to structure the answer clearly: definition, historical context, characteristics, and current status. Make sure it's concise but covers all key points. Avoid any incorrect information. Let me put this all together in a coherent way.\n</think>\n\n한국의 가족 유형 중 하나인 **'대가족'**은 전통적인 가족 구조 중 하나로, **다수의 세대가 함께 거주하는 가족 형태**를 말합니다. 일반적으로 **할머니, 할아버지, 부모, 자녀, 삼촌, 조카 등 여러 세대와 가족 구성원이 함께 살며 공동 생활을 이어가는 구조**를 뜻합니다.  \n\n### 주요 특징:\n1. **세대 간 공동 생활**: 여러 세대가 같은 주택에서 함께 살며 경제적·사회적 지원을 공유합니다.  \n2. **농업 사회의 영향**: 과거 한국은 농업 중심 사회였기 때문에, 대가족은 노동력 공유와 자원 분배를 통해 생계를 유지하는 데 중요한 역할을 했습니다.  \n3. **문화적 기반**: 가족 중심의 가치관과 공동체 의식이 강한 한국 사회에서 대가족 구조는 전통적 가족 문화의 상징이었습니다.  \n\n### 현대적 변화:\n- **현대화와 도시화**: 산업화와 도시화로 인해 대가족 구조는 점차 줄어들고 있습니다. 개인주의적 가치관과 여성의 사회 참여 증가로 인해 가족 단위가 작아지고 있습니다.  \n- **가족 형태의 변화**: 현재 한국 사회에서는 **핵가족**(부모와 자녀만으로 구성된 가족)이나 **소형 가족**이 더 흔하지만, 일부 지역이나 특정 문화적 배경을 가진 가족에서는 대가족 구조를 유지하기도 합니다.  \n\n### 결론:\n대가족은 한국의 전통적인 가족 형태로, 사회적·경제적 안정을 위한 공동체적 삶의 방식을 반영했습니다. 그러나 현대 사회의 변화로 인해 점차 감소하고 있으며, 오늘날에는 대가족이 전통적 문화의 상징으로 남아 있습니다.",

      "simple_pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to explain what a '대가족' is in the context of Korean family types. Let me start by recalling what I know about Korean family structures. I remember that traditional Korean families were often extended families, but with modernization, there's been a shift towards nuclear families. But '대가족' is a term I might have heard before.\n\nFirst, I should define '대가족' in Korean. It translates to 'large family' or 'extended family.' But I need to be precise. In Korean society, a large family typically includes multiple generations living together, like grandparents, parents, children, and sometimes even cousins. This is different from the nuclear family, which consists of just parents and children.\n\nI should mention the historical context. In the past, especially in rural areas, it was common for multiple generations to live under one roof. This was due to economic factors, where family members worked together on farms or in small businesses. The extended family structure provided support and shared resources.\n\nBut I also need to note that this is changing. With urbanization and industrialization, many people now live in nuclear families. However, '대가족' might still be present in some regions or among certain communities. It's important to highlight both the traditional aspects and the current trends.\n\nAdditionally, I should mention the social and cultural significance. Large families can offer emotional support and a sense of community. But they might also have challenges, like resource distribution and individual autonomy. However, since the question is about what '대가족' is, I should focus more on the definition and structure rather than the pros and cons unless asked.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is clear and concise, using appropriate terms. Maybe include examples like grandparents living with their children and grandchildren. Also, mention that it's a traditional structure, which is part of Korea's cultural heritage. But I should check if there are any nuances I'm missing, like differences between rural and urban areas or regional variations.\n\nWait, is '대가족' the same as '확장가족'? I think '확장가족' is another term for extended family, but '대가족' specifically refers to a large family with multiple generations. So I should clarify that. Also, in Korean, sometimes terms can overlap, so it's important to be accurate.\n\nI should structure the answer by defining '대가족,' explaining its composition, historical context, and current status. Maybe mention that while it's less common now, it's still present in some parts of Korea. Also, note that it's part of the traditional family structure that has been influenced by social changes.\n\nI need to avoid any incorrect information. For example, not confusing it with the nuclear family. Also, ensure that the explanation is in Korean as per the user's request. Wait, the user wrote the question in Korean but the answer should be in Korean? Wait, the user's instruction says \"답변:\" but the initial question is in Korean. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's question is in Korean, asking for a description of '대가족' in Korean family types. The user then says \"답변:\" which is the Korean word for \"Answer:\" So the answer should be in Korean. But the user's instruction says \"정확하고 적절하게 답변해주세요\" which means \"Please answer accurately and appropriately.\" So the answer should be in Korean, but the user might have written the question in Korean and expects the answer in Korean. Wait, the user's query is in Korean, but the initial instruction says \"당신은 한국 문화 전문가입니다. 다음 질문에 정확하고 적절하게 답변해주세요.\" So the user is asking for an answer in Korean. Therefore, I need to provide the answer in Korean, not in English.\n\nWait, but the user's message is in Korean, but the initial instruction is in Korean, and the answer should be in Korean. But the user's message is written in Korean, but the assistant's answer is to be in Korean. However, the user's question is in Korean, and the answer should be in Korean. So I need to write the answer in Korean. But the user's query is in Korean, and the assistant is supposed to answer in Korean. However, the user's instruction here is in Korean, but the actual question is in Korean, and the answer should be in Korean. So I need to make sure the answer is in Korean.\n\nWait, maybe the user is using Korean to ask the question, but the answer should be in Korean. However, the user might have intended the answer to be in Korean. Let me confirm. The user wrote the question in Korean, so the answer should be in Korean. Therefore, I need to provide the answer in Korean. But the user might have made a mistake in the initial instruction.

Also, note that it's one of the traditional family types, alongside the nuclear family. Alright, that should cover the main points without being too verbose.\n</think>\n\n한국의 가족 유형 중 하나인 **대가족**(대가족, 대가정)은 **다수의 세대가 한 가정에서 함께 살며 구성된 가족 형태**를 말합니다. 이는 일반적으로 **할아버지, 할머니, 아버지, 어머니, 자녀, 조부모, 형제자매 등 여러 세대가 동거**하는 구조를 포함합니다.  \n\n### 주요 특징:\n1. **전통적 가족 구조**:  \n   - 조선시대부터 이어진 **군주제와 계급 사회**의 영향으로, 가족 내 계층과 역할이 명확히 구분되었으며, **종조(종족의 시작을 알리는 조상)**를 중심으로 한 가족 체계가 강조되었습니다.  \n   - **예절과 효도**(효도, 부모와 조상에 대한 존중)가 중요한 가치로 자리 잡았습니다.  \n\n2. **농촌 중심의 존재**:  \n   - 과거에는 **농촌 지역에서 주로 존재**했으며, 경제적·사회적 안정을 위해 여러 세대가 함께 생활하며 **경제적 지원과 노동 분담**이 이루어졌습니다.  \n   - 도시화와 현대화로 인해 점차 감소하고 있지만, 일부 지역에서는 여전히 유지되고 있습니다.  \n\n3. **경제적·사회적 기능**:  \n   - **경제적 지원**: 여러 세대가 함께 생활하며 노동력과 자원을 공유했습니다.  \n   - **사회적 안전망**: 어려운 시기에 가족 내부에서 지원을 받을 수 있는 구조였습니다.  \n\n4. **현대 사회에서의 변화**:  \n   - **도시화, 개인주의 확산, 여성의 사회 참여 증가**로 인해 대가족 형태는 점차 줄어들고 있으며, **핵가족**(핵가정)이 주류로 자리 잡았습니다.  \n   - 그러나 일부 지역에서는 여전히 대가족이 유지되며, **문화적 전통**의 일부로 간주됩니다.  \n\n### 대가족과의 대비:\n- **핵가족**(핵가정): 부모와 자녀만으로 구성된 가족 형태로, 현대 사회에서 가장 일반적인 구조입니다.  \n- **소형 가족**: 대가족과 달리 형제자매가 적은 가족 형태로, 개인주의적 가치가 강조됩니다.  \n\n대가족은 한국의 전통적 문화와 사회 구조를 반영한 중요한 가족 유형으로, 그 역사적 배경과 변화를 이해하는 데 도움이 됩니다.",

      "format_aware_pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to explain what a \"대가족\" (big family) is in the context of Korean family types. Let me start by recalling what I know. In Korean society, family structures have changed over time. Traditionally, big families were common, especially in rural areas. They usually consist of multiple generations living together, like grandparents, parents, and children. But with modernization and urbanization, this structure has become less common. Now, nuclear families are more prevalent. However, the term \"대가족\" might still refer to extended families where multiple generations cohabit. I should mention the historical context, the composition, and maybe the reasons for its decline. Also, note that while it's less common now, some traditional communities might still maintain this structure. I need to keep it concise, under 500 characters. Let me check the key points: definition, composition, historical prevalence, and current status. Make sure the answer is accurate and consistent.\n</think>\n\n한국의 '대가족'은 여러 세대가 함께 거주하는 가족 형태로, 조상, 부모, 자녀 등이 한 집에서 생활하는 구조를 말합니다. 전통적으로 농촌 사회에서 흔히 나타났으며, 경제적 공동체 형성과 세대 간 돌봄을 위한 역할을 했습니다. 그러나 도시화와 개인주의 확산으로 점차 감소했으며, 현재는 주로 전통적인 지역사회나 특정 문화적 배경에서 유지되고 있습니다. 대가족은 가족 내 역할 분담과 공동체 의식을 강조하는 한국 전통 사회의 특징을 반영합니다.",

Let me start by recalling what I know. 대가족, or extended family, typically includes multiple generations living together. So, it's not just the nuclear family but also grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. I should mention that this structure is common in traditional Korean society. But wait, I need to make sure I'm not mixing it up with other family types. Also, the user specified a descriptive answer, so I need to be concise but informative. Let me check if there are any cultural nuances I should include, like the role of elders or communal living. Oh, right, in some cases, the extended family might live in the same household, sharing responsibilities. I should also note that this is different from the nuclear family, which consists of parents and children only. Make sure the answer is within 500 characters. Let me put that together clearly.\n</think>\n\n한국의 대가족은 부모, 자녀, 조부모, 삼촌, 오누이 등 여러 세대가 함께 살며 공동체적 생활을 이어가는 가족 형태입니다. 전통적인 가족 구조로, 경제적·정서적 지원을 서로 나누며 공동체 의식이 강합니다. 현대에는 핵가족 중심으로 변화하고 있지만, 일부 지역이나 세대에서는 여전히 대가족 형태가 유지되고 있습니다.",
